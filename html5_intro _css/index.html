<h2>Why Is Sailor Moon My Favorite?</h2>
<p>greetings! and welcome to my website. page is based my love for the anime called sailor Moon. starting in the early 90's,sailor moon starts off 
    as story about a young teenage girl who in her past life was a queen of the moon but as the story moves forward, she sent to earth as a regular teenage 
    with no memory of her ever being a queen. eventually later she eventually gained her memory once she ran into her friends that once served to protect her
    against any evil that came her way.<p>
