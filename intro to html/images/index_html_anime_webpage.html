<h2>Welcome to my webpage</h2>
<p>the reason why anime is my favorite thing watch is because, 
when i was younger, anime was a outlet for me. as a kid i went through alot so, anime became a security blanket for me. 
currently today i still am into anime but I look as it as a comfort space. My favorite anime consist of sailor Moon,nana, carole and tuesday just to name a few. i also developed
along the way the love to draw anime as well. over the years i became a reference artist, which is  where i can see a image and draw it exactly how i see it on paper.
not many people can do this without using tracing paper lol </p>
